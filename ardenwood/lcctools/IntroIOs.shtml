<h2>Getting started with LccTools on an iPhone or iPad</h2>

Once you've got the app installed, open it.
It should automatically open to a settings page.
If not, go to the "More" item at the bottom right, then select "Settings"

<ul>
    <li>If your LCC hub is advertising itself,
        you should be able to see its name in the "Visible Hubs" selector at the top of the page.
        Select it. (This is the most likely case when you have a CS-105 as it has this built in)

    <li>If your LCC hub is not advertising itself,
        you'll see only "&lt;No Hub Selected&gt;" at the top.
        Enter your hubs IP address in the center section.
        If you're using a non-standard port (i.e. a port other than 12021),
        also enter that port number.
</ul>

Every copy of the program needs a node number, and they must not be the same.
Generally, LccTools will take care of this for you.
The "Enter a node ID for this program" field will let you provide one of your own
if you'd prefer to do that, but it's usually not necessary to change the value provided.

<p>
Then click "Restart Connection".
After a second or two, you should get a message just above the button that says "Connected to "
and your connection info.
<p>
Now you're ready to go! We're interested in how intuitive the navigation is, so we're not giving step-by-step directions for use, instead just providing a couple notes:
<ul>
    <li>The icons at the bottom select different tools
    <li>When you open the "Nodes" tool, you'll see a list of your existing LCC nodes.
        (If it says "No Selection Yet"", tap "Remote Nodes" at the upper left).
        Select one to see more about it, and (if possible) get a button
        that will let you configure it.
    <li>The fast clock will show real time (i.e. wall clock time)
        unless you have a master LCC fast clock installed on your LCC network.
        This could be a hardware clock from Logic Rail Technologies, the software clock in JMRI,
        the clock in a TCS CS-105 command station, 
        or some other clock master.

    <li>The LccTools app can only interact with your railroad's LCC equipment when it's
        the foremost, active app.
        LccTools can't hear events on your railroad
        if you switch away to another app on your iPhone or iPad.
        LccTools will reactivate when you bring it to the front,
        but it may have missed things.
        It's best to keep LccTools active while operating your railroad.

</ul>

If you have an Apple Watch paired with your iPhone, you 
can run an app on your watch that displays the current fast-clock time
from the LccTools app your iPhone.  There's a 
<a href="IntroWatch.shtml">separate page</a>
on how to set that up.

Feedback on how to improve LccTools, or on any problems you encounter, would be greatly appreciated!

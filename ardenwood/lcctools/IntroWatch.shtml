<h2>Getting started with LccTools on an Apple Watch</h2>

If you have LccTools running on an iPhone that's paired with an Apple Watch,
you can get LccTools to display the fast clock time on your watch.

To set this up:

<ul>
<li> Open the Watch app on your iPhone.  Select your watch and go to the configuration page.
This is the one with "My Faces" at the top.  Scroll down to the Available Apps section.
Press "Install" neet to LccTools.  This will take a few second to complete, at 
which time LccTools will disappear from that section and appear in the "Installed
on Apple Watch" section.

<li>At this point, the LccTools app should be working on your watch.  You can select
    it and see the fast time from the LccTools app on your paired iPhone.
</ul>

There are settings that can make the LccTools Watch app easier to use.

<ol>
<li>On your watch, select the "Settings" app. 
    <ol>
    <li>Select the "General" tab within settings, then select the "Return to Clock"
        option.
    <li>On that new page, scroll down to the LccTools tab and select that.
    <li>That will open a new page that's specific to LccTools.  Select "Custom"
        on that page, the "After 1 hour".  This will prevent your watch from
        going back to the main clockface after two minutes, so that the
        fast clock time will continue to be displayed.
    </ol>
</ol>
     
In the future, we expect to provide a complication that will let you 
display the fast time on your primary watch face. Stay tuned!
